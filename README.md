# My Personal Project

## Application that helps drivers locate parking spots and shows the price of paid parking


- What will the application do? Users will enter a keyword that specifies their general location,
and the application will show the parking spaces whose location contains this keyword and the cost of parking
as well as the availability for parking. Users are free to update the information of parking spaces in the case
that the information is not accurate or up to date. Users are also free to add or remove parking spaces.
- Who will use it? Any one who is driving and needs to find a parking spot can use it. Oftentimes
drivers do not know where to park in the area with which they are not familiar, and this application
can help them park their cars.
- Why is this project of interest? Sometimes when I visit a new place and try to park my car,
I have to spending time search for parking space. This project can make parking more efficient, and
may be useful to a lot of drivers.

**User Story**:
- *As a user, I want to be able to view the list of parking spaces in this city.*
- *As a user, I want to be able to add a new parking space to the list of parking spaces.*
- *As a user, I want to be able to search for available parking space near me.*
- *As a user, I want to be able to update the information about a parking space in the list because the
   previous information is not accurate.*
- *As a user, I want to be able to remove a parking space in the list because it no longer exists.*
- *As a user, when I quit the application, I want to have the option to save the list of parking spaces.*
- *As a user, when I start the application, I want to load the list of parking spaces.*

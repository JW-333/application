# My Personal Project

## Application that helps drivers locate parking spots and shows the price of paid parking


- What will the application do? Users will enter the name of a city, and the application
will show the parking spaces in the city and the price they charge for parking. When users
discover parking spaces that are not shown on the application, they are able to add the location
and price of the parking spots to the list of parking spaces
- Who will use it? Any one who is driving and needs to find a parking spot can use it. Oftentimes
drivers do not know where to park in the area with which they are not familiar, and this application
can help them park their cars.
- Why is this project of interest? Sometimes when I visit a new place and try to park my car,
I have to spending time search for parking space. This project can make parking more efficient, and
may be useful to a lot of drivers.

**User Story**:
- *As a user, I want to be able to view the list of parking spaces in this city.*
- *As a user, I want to be able to add a new available parking space to the list of parking spaces.*
